    @ This is slightly convoluted, but is mainly done for performance reasons. It is better
    @ to hit ROM just once and then do 3 really simple instructions then do 2 ldrsbs however annoying
    @ this is. Also, since all this code is in IWRAM and we never hit ROM otherwise, all accesses
    @ are sequential and exactly the size of the bus to ROM (16 bits), so hopefully this will be super fast.
    @
    @ The next 3 instructions set up the current value in r6 to be in the expected format
    @ 1 = 2s complement marks (so if negative, these are all 1s, if positive these are 0s)
    @ L = the left sample
    @ R = the right sample
    @ 0 = all zeros
    @ Split into bytes
    @
    @ At this point
    @                        r6 = | 1 | 1 | L | R | where the upper bytes are 1s if L is negative. No care about R
                         @ asr #8 | 1 | 1 | 1 | L | drop R off the right hand side
    and r7, r5, r6, asr #8 @ r7 = | 0 | 0 | 1 | L | exactly what we want this to be. The mask puts the 1 as 00001111 ready for the shift later
    lsl r6, r6, #24        @ r6 = | R | 0 | 0 | 0 | drop everything except the right sample

@ The idea for this solution came from pimpmobile:
@ https://github.com/kusma/pimpmobile/blob/f2b2be49e806ca2a0d99cf91b3838d6d10f86b7d/src/pimp_mixer_clip_arm.S
@
@ The register should be 127 bigger then what you actually want, and we'll correct for that later. Hence the
@ add instructions in `load_sample`.
@
@ The idea behind this is in the bit patters of -128 and 127 which are 10000000 and 01111111 respectively,
@ and we want to clamp the value between them.
@
@ The first instruction calculates `-((sample + 128) >> 8)`. If sample is between -128 and 127, then
@ 0 <= sample + 128 <= 255 which means that shifting that right by 8 is 0. Hence the zero flag will be set, so
@ the `andne` instruction won't execute.
@
@ If the sample is outside of a signed 8 bit value, then `sample >> 8` will either be -1 or 1 (we assume that samples)
@ don't go too high, but the idea still works, so you can generalise this further if you want. This value is stored in TEMP
@
@ -1 has binary expansion (as a 32-bit integer) of all 1s and 1 of all zeros and then a 1.
@ So (-1 logical >> 24) gives 11111111 and (1 logical >> 24) gives 00000000 so register is clamped between these two values.
